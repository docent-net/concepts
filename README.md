concepts
==============

It's normal that every of us gets an idea. I usually wrote those ideas to my 
Evernote or whatever. But I think that it could be interesting when those
ideas could be somehow commented - or just that I could have a feedback. I
believe, that most of solutions should be open - sourced. That's why I created
this 'concepts' repo. I'll put here my ideas and also - every interesting
concept I heard on talks / conferences / events.
