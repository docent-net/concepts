# This concepts covers case of speeding up the Linux boot process.
# Believe me (or not) - it made me someday win the Samsung R&D Competition

# Feel free to add / write anything here - this is very interesting topic from

1. Do it only on specific runlevel - i.e. 2 as we use it on servers.
2. Obvious things: grub timeout 0, automate drives decryption process (can't say how - this is for security reasons)
3. Recompile kernel. Seriously. Make it tiny and skinny - throw away any unused modules. If working on slow hardware You can really get a nice kick.
4. Profile boot - process (e.g. bootchart). See what's happening there. Any weird behaviours?
5. Think how to make loading of servicess parallel. This is the main problem. Some distros have it (i.e. Debian) some not (Centos).
6. Do services really need to depend on network resources? I've seen situations, where some not - network service depended on NFS. Wat???
7. Tune up kernel params, set vm.swappiness=0 for boot time. After that you can set whatever you had.
8. (thanks to Frogu, https://github.com/frogu): use ld_preload for libraries. ldd would help to define what libraries we're talking about.
