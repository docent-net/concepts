1. As we want to have our data accessible on any devices (PCs, mobile, laptops, 
   servers) thus we should stick to OwnCloud solution http://owncloud.org
2. Owncloud has many sec flaws, so in order to keep things secure we should
   create own PKI (own CA) and than create webcerts & user certs. No access
   should be allowed without proper user SSL cert
3. Also there is need for a VPN (VPN-access only to whole owncloud solution).
   Looks like OpenVPN will be good enough (with lack of iOS support - sorry).
4. HA considerations:
   a) As we're basing on VPN access only than OpenVPN should have been deployed
      in HA manner.
   b) We should have minimum 2 storage nodes synced with GlusterFS replica bricks.
      As it is all over VPN than we don't have to add any SSH-tunneling layer here.
      But.. maybe we should. Or at least different VLAN for sync (but than our HA
      would not be that High as VLAN means same DC; it would be better to keep
      HA storage nodes in different DCs... so maybe GlusterFS sync over SSH tunnel).
   c) DNS HA could be achieved via classical 2 - nodes (master-slave and AXFR) arch.
      DNSes could be deployed on those 2 storage nodes in different DCs.
   d) Load balancing - classical RoundRobin over DNS (so semi - LB). As there's no 
      way to achieve IP-failover over different DCs withoug BGP involved, than we
      could also stick to some enterprise solution (Anycast on DNSMadeEasy or IP
      Failover between DCs in Softlayer/IBM DCs or AWS. But we _do_not_ want to rely
      on any non-open-soource solution. So we have to stay with RoundRobin over DNSes.
5. It's all about encryption. Servers storage should be encrypted (both - whole disk
   enc and separately just GlusterFS storage). Also we should keep any client-side
   storage encrypted. But this one could be achieved only by strict and manual 
   encryption on the client side.
